# deep-learning-gaming
This is the graduation project I prepared in school to get my B.Sc. degree in computer engineering. It learns how to play Super Mario Bros. game using deep learning which can be considered a subset of machine learning. It uses Keras for its deep learning library with TensorFlow backend. [Gym Super Mario](https://github.com/ppaquette/gym-super-mario) environment bundle is used for OpenAI Gym.
In first stage, the best model from three different models for this problem is founded. In second stage, the model is trained on the first level of Super Mario Bros for a long duration. At the last stage, training process is stopped and the trained model is used on a different level. It is investigated if there is a significant improvement compared to a random model.

## Requirements
* Keras 2.1.5
* FCEUX 2.2.2 
* Gym Super Mario 0.0.7
* OpenAI Gym 0.92
